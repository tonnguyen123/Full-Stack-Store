I hosted Server on Render for Back End and Front End on Netlify.
You can test the app on Netlify URL here:

https://main--ton-store.netlify.app/

I did not show API keys of online services that I used here, so you can only see settings here are for local host if you want to download and test at your machine. If you do not want to download, feel free to test on
the website URL I provided above. I edited the server hosted by Render in this project before and deployed it on Netlify.   

How to run:

Donwload .Zip file from this resporitoy

***To run Server local host:
cd server
node index.js

***To run Client local host:
cd client
npm sart


Thank you!
