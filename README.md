I hosted Server on Render for Back End and Front End on Netlify.
You can test the app on Netlify URL here:

https://main--ton-store.netlify.app/

I did not show API keys of online services that I used here, so you can only see settings here are for local host if you want to download and test at your machine. If you do not want to download, feel free to test on
the website URL I provided above. I edited the server hosted by Render in this project before and deployed it on Netlify.   

How to run:

Donwload .Zip file from this resporitoy

From the terminal or command prompt inside the proejct folder of VS Code:

To run Server local host:
cd server

node index.js

To run Client local host:
cd client

npm sart

After you start the app at local host. Some pictures below will navigate you through functions of the web app:
